here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year without hindering traffic flow, only a simple, temporary shifting lanes until the system has been turned off behind the first responders. 

(forgive any fractured thinking, still recovering from major trauma, and still being affected by hate crimes each and every single day still..   -  recovering is going doing super great though, but there is a few things here and there im still working on and i suck at writing online. id prefer on the phone or in person but thats just me, here, its too easy to ramble -> edit -> repeat.) 

needs a bit of work, for desgining the system is rather simple but thinking is still very difficult in these conditions, but the core is there, i just had to start.  but the AI says its pretty good right now, so ill take its pointers and write a few more things.  

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

still working on bits here and there for the paper but people are vultures sometimes, and i really want something more than ive ever wanted before in my life, so had to take this approach and publish as fast as i could in any way i could - now  once complete or to the best of my ability till i can think again in good conditions, ill send it off to everyone everywhere in this country.

its really hard to think still i know my work has gaps but i cant see much still. even if i never escape from this, others will be better off. 


i should just post all my notes on this that i did as well, but in my current living conditions im suprised i did this much or could even think of this basic idea.

    maybe TODO's:
        -doesnt show option to view doc. on iOS phone so will add another format 
        -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
        -Q&A from professionals.
        -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
        -Edge cases & solutions.
        -possible effects on traffic stability.
        -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt.

no sorrys.  a rule that helped give me what was taken from me. every other women on planet earth and any newly discovered planets or exoplanets with human life, all those women can just back up and walk away because ive found the only person i could ever wish to want and dream to have. 
m. is the reason for all this right now. your life is being saved from my work one day, because of her. got me feeling like... me and her are going have the world one day. i can't explain the story in her eyes i read each time ive looked into her eyes. 



i write too much from my heart without a filter on my brain, this is why in person is the only way i should talk to people. i hate being online like this. i don't understand the internet... in addition, i feel when im being tortured by my neighbors, still, the effect of me writing was one of the only forms of communication i had during the worst of it, and when im going through it i write and write and write making me seem crazy but its an effect of the torture called word vomit and its triggered by their actions against me daily. takes a few hours away from it to recover. as badly as i want to say how i feel about her and what i think about her and wish for her and us and the thrill of the chase that she deserves, idk feel wrong still yet. until i know know. i will say this, i want to be by her side in everything, and I fantasize about us sitting together studying and reading and talking forever about everything we dream and imagine and wish for. then i want to work on making those things happen.
