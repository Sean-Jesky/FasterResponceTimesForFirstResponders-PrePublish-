here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year.

needs a bit of work, for desgining the system is rather simple but thinking is still very difficult in these conditions, but the core is there, i just had to start, and getting this out there feels like the start of the only great thing i could ever imagine. i just know, every bone in my body says so. just trying to impress one person really.. every other women (every other women is just a girl compared to her) can just walk away; i feel like ive found the one, but she hasnt said a word so shes just - my WOMD for now.... off topic..is it though? taylor swift would say no i think.

granted its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whoes like... the best at this stuff..

still working on bits here and there for the paper but people are vultures sometimes, and i really want something more than ive ever wanted before in my life, so had to take this approach and publish as fast as i could in any way i could - now  once complete or to the best of my ability till i can think again in good conditions, ill send it off to everyone everywhere in this country.

its really hard to think still i know my work has gaps but i cant see much still. even if i never escape from this, others will be better off. 


i should just post all my notes on this that i did as well, but in my current living conditions im suprised i did this much or could even think of this basic idea.
