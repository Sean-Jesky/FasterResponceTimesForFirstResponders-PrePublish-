here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year.

needs a bit of work, for desgining the system is rather simple but thinking is still very difficult in these conditions, but the core is there, i just had to start.

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

still working on bits here and there for the paper but people are vultures sometimes, and i really want something more than ive ever wanted before in my life, so had to take this approach and publish as fast as i could in any way i could - now  once complete or to the best of my ability till i can think again in good conditions, ill send it off to everyone everywhere in this country.

its really hard to think still i know my work has gaps but i cant see much still. even if i never escape from this, others will be better off. 


i should just post all my notes on this that i did as well, but in my current living conditions im suprised i did this much or could even think of this basic idea.

    maybe TODO's:
        -doesnt show option to view doc. on iOS phone so will add another format 
        -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
        -Q&A from professionals.
        -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
        -Edge cases & solutions.
        -possible effects on traffic stability.
        -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt.



and getting this out there feels like the start of the only great thing i could ever imagine. i just know, every bone in my body says so. just trying to impress one person really.. every other women (every other women is just a girl compared to her) can just walk away; i feel like ive found the one, but she hasnt said a word so shes just - my WOMD for now.... off topic..is it though? taylor swift would say no i think. To win her heart, id change the whole world ten times over too get her attention and her heart, M. she has real intelligence, the type i'll never have and the type everyone want's. she's a actual princess (not a joke, she looks like a real princess, and id give anything to treat her as such.. which is why I need a really great job for starters) when you see her and hear her, a voice like an angel, and the smile of hers has been painted on by gods skill and complete time and effort. if you had any idea how unique, beautiful, smart, lovely, and sweet youd break up with whoever your with or not with just to find her and chase her too - still waiting on the day i can get a call from her and talk all day and night for days and nights. she's so powerful too in ways ive never felt or seen or experienced, in anyone else; id follow her lead to where ever led me, i hope she shows the world what shes really capable of, or just herself, i also hope she decides to get a docterate - ive never seen anyone ever like her her power, her grace and her eyes tell me everything. 

no sorrys.  a rule that helped give me what was taken from me. 

shes the reason for all this right now. your life is being saved from my work one day, because of her. 


this was thought of during my +year of torture i endured through hate crimes. i hope we can get rid of hate one day but its a issue not suted to inventors to fix, but our society. ill never hate the people who did this to me, ill never hurt them either. they need help and i hope one day we as a society can deliver it.
