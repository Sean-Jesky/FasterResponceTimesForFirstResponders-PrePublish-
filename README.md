here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year. 

needs a bit of work, for desgining the system is rather simple but thinking is still very difficult in these conditions, but the core is there, i just had to start.  but the AI says its pretty good right now, so ill take its pointers and write a few more things.  

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

still working on bits here and there for the paper but people are vultures sometimes, and i really want something more than ive ever wanted before in my life, so had to take this approach and publish as fast as i could in any way i could - now  once complete or to the best of my ability till i can think again in good conditions, ill send it off to everyone everywhere in this country.

its really hard to think still i know my work has gaps but i cant see much still. even if i never escape from this, others will be better off. 


i should just post all my notes on this that i did as well, but in my current living conditions im suprised i did this much or could even think of this basic idea.

    maybe TODO's:
        -doesnt show option to view doc. on iOS phone so will add another format 
        -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
        -Q&A from professionals.
        -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
        -Edge cases & solutions.
        -possible effects on traffic stability.
        -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt.

no sorrys.  a rule that helped give me what was taken from me. 

shes the reason for all this right now. your life is being saved from my work one day, because of her. got me feeling like the world could be ours, a future I belive I seen in her eyes.

in addition, I only wanted her and only her opinion and remarks on this before i published, her word is the only one id wait outside all day just to hear. 

this was thought of during my +year of torture i endured through hate crimes. i hope we can get rid of hate one day but its a issue not suted to inventors to fix, but our society. ill never hate the people who did this to me, ill never hurt them either. they need help and i hope one day we as a society can deliver it. 
being tortured again soon after publishing. fuck this world. i wish i had one person i could actually talk to right now. for that id give up everything and anything. i prayed to god to see her and i did the next day at a store with ice cream, maybe if i pray again itll somehow help.
