here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year.

deal with i, needs a bit of work, for desgining the system, but the rest is there, i just had to start and getting this out there feels like 
the start of the next great thing.

granted its pretty easy to set up  and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whoes like... the best at this stuff..


still working on bits here and there for the paper but people are vultures sometimes  and i really want something more than ive ever wanted before in my life, so had to take this approach


its really hard to think still i know my work has gaps but i cant see much still. even if i never escape from this, others will be better off.
